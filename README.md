Meal_APP-Project
I have done this project with the help of HTML, CSS, JS.
The Meal App is a web application that allows users to search for and explore various meal recipes. Users can view details of different meals, mark their favorite recipes, and access a collection of their favorite meals.

Features
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

Toggle Sidebar: Users can toggle the sidebar to access their list of favorite meals and easily navigate between different sections of the app.

Search and Filtering: The app provides a search bar where users can enter keywords to search for specific meal recipes. The search results are fetched from an external API.

Favorite Meals: Users can mark meals as their favorites by clicking the heart icon. The number of favorite meals is displayed in the top-right corner.

Detailed Meal View: Users can view detailed information about a specific meal, including its name, category, ingredients, instructions, and a video link to a related YouTube tutorial.

Usage
Upon loading the app, users will see a list of meal cards. Each card displays the meal's name, photo, and a brief description.

Users can use the search bar at the top to enter keywords and filter meal results based on their search.

Clicking on a meal card will lead users to a detailed view of the meal. Here, users can find more information about the meal, including its category, ingredients, and instructions for preparation.

Users can mark meals as their favorites by clicking the heart icon. The total number of favorite meals is displayed in the top-right corner of the app.

Clicking the toggle button on the top-left corner of the app opens or closes the sidebar, allowing users to view their list of favorite meals.
